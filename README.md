## About the repository

The purpose of this repository is to present applications of different programming languages in problems of optimization, data science and machine learning.


# PYTHON :snake:

Anyone who has ever encountered a data analysis problem that a marking tool has not completely or efficiently solved the problem with, raises their hand there :raised_hand: .
In the world of data analysis, it becomes increasingly necessary to step out of your comfort zone, and look for other tools that are useful for the universe of a data scientist. Fortunately in this scenario Python is a good option.
If your profile has an inclination to code, now is the time to get your hands dirty, in a simple way, believe me, coding has never been easier. If you are already convinced to give Python a chance, check out the advantages of this choice:
The Python language is a high level, open source, very active online community, easy to learn, imperative, interpreted by scripts, object oriented, functional, with strong typing and dynamics. Programming in Python is like writing a letter to the computer, a letter in English, it is worth mentioning.
