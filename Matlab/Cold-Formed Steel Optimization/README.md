# Abstract
## OPTIMIZATION OF COLD-FORMED STEEL LIPPED CHANNEL COLUMNS WITH MANUFACTURING CONSTRAINTS USING METAHEURISTIC ALGORITHMS

Cold-formed steel (CFS) cross-sections can be optimized to increase their load-carrying capacity, leading to more efficient and economical structural systems. This dissertation aims to provide a practical methodology that would enable the development of optimized CFS lipped channel columns sections with maximum compressive strength for practical applications. The optimized sections are designed to comply with the NBR 14762 geometrical specifications and a certain number of manufacturing and practical constraints. The compressive strengths of the sections are determined based on the Direct Strength Method (DSM) adopted in the Brazilian guide, while the optimization process is performed using four distinct metaheuristic algorithms (Genetic Algorithms, Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Artificial Bee Colony). In total, five different CFS lipped channel prototypes are considered in the optimization process. The critical buckling loads, required by DSM, are determined using Finite Strip Method (FSM) analysis and Machine Learning techniques (ML). The results indicate optimized sections providing a compressive capacity, which is up to 217% higher than standard shapes with the same amount of material.
