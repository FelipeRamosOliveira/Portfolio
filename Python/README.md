# MACHINE LEARNING ðŸ§ 
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.

## Computer Vision :robot:
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do. 
Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, eg in the forms of decisions.

## Geoprocessing :earth_americas:
Geoprocessing is the computerized processing of georeferenced data. The geoprocessing allows the extraticotion of cartographic information (maps, topographic maps and plans) and information that can be associated with the coordinates of these maps, maps or plans.

## Natural Language Processing :speaking_head: :speech_balloon:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subarea of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that studies the capacity and limitations of a machine in the sense of human language. The purpose of NLP is to provide computers with an ability to understand and compose texts. "Understanding" a text means recognizing the context, performing syntactic, semantic, lexical and morphological analysis, creating summaries, extracting information, interpreting the senses, analyzing the feelings and even learning concepts from the processed texts.
