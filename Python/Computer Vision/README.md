# FASHION MNIST :shirt: :jeans:


We will use a data set, a data set called Fashion-MNIST, organized with images of several different clothes, and it was made by the research group called Zalando Research. In addition, we will make our code with a Google Special library on Deep Neural Networks called TensorGlow, as our lowest level layer for communicating with a machine.
Then, we'll write most of the code using Keras, a high-level API that is above TensorFlow, and we'll do all of that using a Python language. We will import these libraries, load our data set, explore and display our data, make a graph, we will also normalize this image, create, compile, train and save our model. We will visualize the accuracy, the loss, and feel what it is during the course, know if the model is doing well or not, adjust it, test it and evaluate it.
With that we will begin to understand what this world of Deep Learning is, and how we move around in all these probabilities that are not as exact as we would like.
